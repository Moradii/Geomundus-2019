## Retrieve and process satellite images time series towards data analysis in R

Geomundus-2019, November 30, Manuel Montesino and Mehdi Moradi

## Abstract

Satellite images are valuable sources to monitor the changes happening in the earth's surface patterns as well as dynamics. However, the analyses of such images often require a long series of remotely-sensed data. In two hands-on sessions, we first cover the use of the R package RGISTools to facilitate the handling of satellite images time series from major satellite programs, such as Landsat, MODIS, and Sentinel, covering in a comprehensive manner the retrieval, and customizing and processing satellite images. Having retrieved and processed satellite images time series of e.g. land surface temperature (LST) and/or vegetation indices from MODIS, we then review some of the most considered change-point and trend detection methods, and make use of them to discuss the areas where have faced changes over time together with the corresponding time of change for some provinces/cities in Europe.
